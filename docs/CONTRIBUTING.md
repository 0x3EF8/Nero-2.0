# Contributing to Nero 2.0

Hey there, future contributor! I’m feeling a tad lazy and can’t be bothered to write a comprehensive set of contributing guidelines. But here’s the deal: If you want to help out, just make sure your contributions are meaningful and don’t break anything. Seriously, nobody wants a broken bot. 

Feel free to submit pull requests, but make sure to:
- Write clean code (I mean, it’s not rocket science).
- Test your changes before submitting (that would be a nice touch).
- Follow the basic principles of code etiquette—don’t be that person who shouts “It works on my machine!”

Thanks for stopping by! If you have questions, well, I’m not going to write an FAQ section, so good luck with that!
