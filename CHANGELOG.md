# Changelog for Nero 2.0

Ah, the changelogâ€”a place where I should probably put in some effort, but Iâ€™m feeling a bit too lazy to document every little change. Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve got so far:

- **Initial Release**: Nero 2.0 is finally here! Hooray! ðŸŽ‰
- **Subsequent Updates**: Honestly, if you want to keep track of what changed, youâ€™ll have to look at the commits. I know, itâ€™s not the most user-friendly approach, but hey, Iâ€™m just not in the mood to list every change. 

If you really care about the nitty-gritty details, dive into the code repository and see what I was up to. You might find some surprisesâ€”or not. Who knows? Enjoy sifting through the mess!
