# Changelog for Nero 2.0

Welcome to the changelog! I should probably put in more effort here, but let's be realâ€”Iâ€™m feeling a bit lazy to document every single change. So hereâ€™s a quick rundown of whatâ€™s happened so far:

- **Originally Named Hexabot (2023)**: This project started off as Hexabot before transforming into Nero 2.0. It got a makeover because users and developers faced issues with the core (fca-unofficial) login problem.

- **Initial Release**: Nero 2.0 is finally here! Hooray! ðŸŽ‰

- **Fixed Some Bugs**: We took care of a few pesky bugs. Who doesnâ€™t love a good fix, right?

- **Optimized Performance**: We made some tweaks to help everything run smoother. Just the usual optimization stuff to make your experience better.

- **Module Export Improvements**: We improved how modules are exported for easier use. 

- **Whatâ€™s New**: 
  - Oh, and guess what? Weâ€™ve added a delightful collection of new bugs! ðŸŽ‰ Because, honestly, whatâ€™s a project without a few surprises? It wouldnâ€™t be as interesting if everything just worked perfectly, right?

- **Subsequent Updates**: If youâ€™re curious about the nitty-gritty details of whatâ€™s changed, youâ€™ll have to check the commit history. I know, itâ€™s not the easiest way to keep track, but Iâ€™m just not up for listing every little change.

If you really want to dive deeper, feel free to explore the code repository. You might find some surprisesâ€”or maybe not. Enjoy sifting through the chaos!
